[Some time around 3500 BCE]

[Before 2000 BCE]
Baln existed a few hundred years before. They were the first dwarven settlement, and they spoke Primordial.
Floraindelen existed only a few decades, which is small compared to Baln. They spoke Ancient Elvish.

[2000 BCE]
Glienedràem is formed. Hathklosh rises in the Heirfgrian Forest.

[1930 BCE]
Haear is formed. Floraindelen collapsed due to an invasion of earth and stone elementals, which were coming from a different plane. A month later, a group travelled to a fortress located in a massive cavern known as Krikihbolg Stone Fortress. They entered the fortress, and destroyed the portal that lead the elementals to the material plane.
Inglinimpara is also formed where Heirfgria is now.

[1800 BCE]
Inglinimpara starts a conquest, known as the Inglinimparan Conquest. They first target Hathklosh, and won.

[1770 BCE]
Glienedràem collapses, from the Inglinimparan Conquest. Anzudengot, the current king of Haear at this time, took advantage of this and took over the remains of Glienedràem. Baln was running low on food. They started to take exessive food from the village to feed their soldiers, and so there was a revolution, and was transformed into Banir, under new kings. Primordal branched into a new language, called Primordial Dwarven.

[1800 BCE]
Kingdom of Thissalfiran is created, named after it's founder. The Kingdom of Thissalfiran spoke Ancient Elvish.

[1120 BCE]
Haear collapses. Borusdalis, and Veilodin rises from Haear. The Kingdom of Thissalfiran attacked Borusdalis, destroying it. Refugees fled to Veilodin, while some went east, forming Borusdaliandur.
Kiliidhuuk collapsed from the Inglinimparan Conquest.

[910 BCE]
Borusdaliandur formed a peace treaty with Veilodin. Borusdaliandur was lead by a sorcerer named Borusdagl. Inglinimpara tried to attack Veilodin, but were intercepted by Borusdaliandur's army. Inglinimpara lost. Borusdaliandur then attacked what was originally Kiliidhuuk, destroying it.

[900 BCE]
Borusdaliandur and Veilodin decided to invade Inglinimpara, and took it over.

[830 BCE]
Shaefklimper rises in the Heirfgrian Forest.

[740 BCE]
A group of earth elementals attacked Borusdaliandur. A warrior named Hondaf, took a mace and axe, and went to defend a part of the city called Namiam against the earth elementals. Surprisingly, he destroyed most of the elementals before he retreated due to injury. He was gifted a star glising, which was named Star Glising of Namiam.

<First Age of Peace START>

[760 BCE]
Hondaf died a natural death. His body was buried in a memorial along with his Star Glising of Namiam, which was then moved to a tomb.

<First Age of Peace END>

[680 BCE]
Veilodin collapsed, when a massive disease broke out. It was an incurable disease at it's time. A few hundred people traveled to Borusdaliandur. However, to stop mass migration and potential disease outbreak, Borusdaliandur had artillery to try and kill any immigrants that tried to enter. Almost half of them died to either disease, or the massacre, known as the Veilodin Migration Massacre.

[650 BCE]
Borusdaliandur fell. The people of Veilodin traveled south, to the Taribian desert. They formed an empire, named Zarapib. Zarapib was also led by a sorcerer, named Junas.

[610 BCE]
Junas was assassinated by a group of bandits. Zarapib almost collapsed, but was saved by Haronin using a spear to fend off the bandits. He became a hero, and was given the title of emperor.

[550 BCE]
Emperor Haronin died.

[520 BCE]
Kingdom of Thissalfiran fell. A new empire, named Kingdom of Thissalfiran II rose, under Uluranush.

[490 BCE]
A group of explorers from Zarapib decided to travel north, to where current day Hendril is. They established a settlement called Grutorus, which would in the future become a village, then town, then kingdom.

[450 BCE]
Zarapib collapsed, and Tarib rose, taking over it's remains.

[360 BCE]
Grutorus fully became a kingdom. In the Kingdom of Thissalfiran II, a group of explorers went to where current day Ranûdel is, and put down a new Kingdom, named Rànûladàen.

[200 BCE]
Shaefklimper collapsed.

The forgotten settlement was abandoned after an attack from civil war, but only after few years did they remember this tablet, labeling it as an "ancient" magic item. When an adventurous group decided to search the ruins of this settlement, they found nothing. A group of fey, one dryad and several satyrs, had already taken the tablet. Lànassil, who was the dryad, found this tablet.

[40 AD]
An ideology of retribution sprouted in Furnalfa. A group of fey adopted to this ideology, where humanoids of the intelligent races, the ones that live in the material realm, were destroying nature and even Talmundur by burning wood, killing animals, and even go as far to call wizards cultists. There were just a little more fey that followed this ideology than the ones that didn't.

Lànassil was one of the few that actively opposed it, joining in the local fey military that fought against this. A few years later when they attacked the region she lived in, they killed her tree and stole her tablet. Lànassil then fled to the material plane, and now resides in the forest in the peninsula southwest of Esrelu.
