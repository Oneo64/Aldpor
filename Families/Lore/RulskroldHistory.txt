While wandering in the forest, Fraldr, Gorðr and Lalfrel sees the draugr Haldigr Dalsdavu I walking far away. They weren't able to see who it was, or know that it was Haldigr Dalsdavu I. They quickly escape, saying that they saw a "cloaked man who was evil". They returned without a scratch, and told the rest of the family.

Two days later, Ljorn saw the same draugr just outside the forest during nighttime. He hid back into his home when Haldigr I turned to look at the village, thinking the draugr saw him. Because of this, he has been paranoid whenever he's inside a forest, especially boreal ones.

Yngvild decided to go alone into the forest and returned without a scratch with a two mushrooms in her hand, wanting them be cooked in the next stew. One turned out to be an ekraldys toadstool, a poisonous mushroom, when her mother Mifrün looked at it before actually putting it into the pot. The other was a normal non-poisonous brown mushroom.

(August)
While in the woods cutting a tree down, Alfr and Ulfrir were almost crushed by a tree, but it was stopped by another tree. During this incident, Ulfrir was grazed by a falling fir cone. This resulted in a light, faint scar on his left brow ridge. Because of this, they were more cautious when felling trees.

Ljorn and Alfr goes on first adventure to to explore the ruins of an ancient castle that had spread by rumor. This castle ruins is located in the peninsula southwest of Esrelu. Baulnir and Ennu goes with them. During the exploration, they find a couple of draugar that attacks the party while inside. Alfr gets cut, on the left leg.
Ljorn discovers an old tome, but doesn't read it. Instead, he keeps it in one of the chests. Alfr found a spear, and a bronze ring, which was gifted to Algord. When they returned, Ljorn bought a sword.

Alfr and Ulfrir start their combat practicing with spears, using wooden poles instead of actual spears.

(October)
A few months later, Ljorn rediscovers the old tome, and read it. He finds out it teaches very basic magic, and he learns it.

(June)
After transporting two barrels of fish from Lismerlav to Argonlav, Þrein (father of Baulnir and Ennu) offered Alfr to protect his karve for a week and watch over it at night, and will pay him three coppers for every night watched (food is provided). Alfr agrees and goes with him to guard over the karve.

During his guarding, Alfr caught two bandits skulking around looking to steal something. Alfr tried chasing the bandits, but they disappeared into the forest. Þrein heard of this, and decided to give five coppers instead of three after seeing the footprints of bare feet near the coast where his boat was.

After a week, Alfr returns to his family's home, with the coppers promised.


[Year 972]
(September)
An incoming invasion of Yûmlathnaric elves came from the southwest, going past Argonlav. Ljorn participated as a war mage, and was shot with an arrow on the left shoulder. They won the battle. Ljorn scavenged the bodies of slain participants, and took back home a bearded axe, a saber (liuyuedao), a helmet, a necklace, and a ring. He sold the saber and ring.

At the same time, a group of centaurs from Vatakond raids Argonlav during the invasion from Yûmlathnar. A centaur broke down their door, wielding a longaxe and a longbow. Alfr was not there at the time, he had gone to buy linseed oil. Algord and Ulfrir each took an axe, and but Algord was hit with the centaur's longaxe. Ulfrir killed the centaur, and took a bow from the centaur.

A couple of days later, Ljorn returns back to their home. Learning that the centaur broke down their door, he would try to protect his family from anything like that. Ljorn had also lost his skill in axes in favor for magic and sword.

(December)
Yngvild got Ljorn to teach her a spell, Prestidigitation. She then used this spell to show Ulfrir a handful of mud in her hands, when it was just a quick illusion.
