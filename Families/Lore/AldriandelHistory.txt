Yaer 972
Vielthori senses a group of undead approaching from an unknown direction. She alerted the guards, but they did not believe her. About ten minutes later, the group of undead, made entirely of vamerks enter Pendlas Mus. The guards gathered to kill the vamerks, and Vielthori assisted them, killing every undead. She felt extremely, and unusually uncomfortable the presence of these vamerks, and could sense them from a hundred meters away. After this, she began to exessively dislike undeath.
