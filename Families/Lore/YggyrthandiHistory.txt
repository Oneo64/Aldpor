Baulnir and Ennu go on an adventure to explore an ancient castle's ruins, after hearing of a rumor. They go with Ljorn and Alf. This castle was on the peninsula on the southwest of Esrelu.

During the exploration, they were attacked by a couple of draugr. They were able to fend off the draugar.

Baulnir found a magical leather helmet that gave a slight darkvision when worn.


[Year 970]
(June)
A group of bandits from the south raided Lismerlav, there were around 30 of them. Baulnir helped defend the village, killing two bandits.

While this was happening, three bandits tried to steal 횧rein's boat. They were able to sail it 10 meters away from the shoreline before 횧rein and another bowman shot and killed the three bandits.

Two days later after transporting two barrels of fish from Lismerlav to Argonlav, 횧rein offered Alfr to protect his karve for a week and watch over it at night, and will pay him three coppers for every night watched (food is provided). Alfr agrees and goes with him to guard over the karve.

During his guarding, Alfr caught two bandits skulking around looking to steal something. Alfr tried chasing the bandits, but they disappeared into the forest. 횧rein heard of this, and decided to give five coppers instead of three after seeing the footprints of bare feet near the coast where his boat was.
