To brew a potion, you add water, and a catalyst, along with it's ingredients. You will then need to shake the potion up for at least a few seconds. You can then enhance the effects by leaving it boiling for a few hours, which will increase it's potency by about 25 percent.

Liquids:
Obviously, water is required, and it is strictly water. Any kind of liquid that isn't water will not work.

Catalysts:
A catalyst is required to make a potion. Without a catalyst, a "potion" would just be a gross mixture that might make you sick.
A catalyst is a magical object/liquid that is what makes the potion's effect. Any nonliving thing that has an innate magical connection can be considered a catalyst. The catalyst must also be completely submerged in the liquid to work.

Here are a list of catalyst examples:
	The snow, or foliage where an intense magical battle happened.
	The foliage near a magical creatures' lair.
	The grass from a magic academy's training grounds.
	The water from an ancient magical well. (These catalysts can also be the water required.)
