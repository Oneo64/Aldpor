To travel to a universe, the universe must meet these requirements:
	A physical being that isn't a celestial or fiend must not be overly powerful.
	Example:
		1. A colossal being that can destroy planets easily, super saiyans that can blow a moon up, existance erasure/reality warping.
		2. Creating life-size, or inescapable black holes.

	Technology must not be ridiculous.
	Example:
		1. Something that isn't magic/superpower that can shrink someone to the size of an atom.
		2. Warp drive (don't be confused with hyperspace) that goes at the speed of light. (you will freeze in time if you go so fast)

	Biology must make sense.
	Example:
		1. Plastic Man can stretch as far as he wants, even if it means to reach the sun.
		2. Shapeshifting into a ridiculously powerful god.

	If there is a major drawback to any of these, or the most powerful attacks that can be regularly performed can be dodged by ordinary people, then it's ok.
