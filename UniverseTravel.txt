To travel to a universe, the universe must meet these requirements:
	A physical being that isn't a celestial or fiend must not be overly powerful.
	Example:
		1. A colossal being that can destroy planets easily, super saiyans that can blow a moon up, existance erasure/reality warping.
		2. Creating life-size, or inescapable black holes.
		3. Instantly killing anything, even unkillable beings.
		4. Destroying ze multiverse because yes. (how is that even supposed to work)

	Technology must not be ridiculous.
	Example:
		1. Something that isn't magic/superpower that can shrink someone to the size of an atom.
		2. Warp drive/hyperspace is ok, as long as there isn't shit like destroying a spaceship by ramming it (as seen in the star wars trilogy)

	Biology must make sense.
	Example:
		1. Plastic Man can stretch as far as he wants, even if it means to reach the sun.
		2. Shapeshifting into a ridiculously powerful god.
		3. Skin with the density of this number: 1000000000000000

	If there is a major drawback to any of these, or the most powerful attacks that can be regularly performed can be dodged by ordinary people, then it's ok.
	Example: When shooting at someone with a pistol, it is possible that you miss, and even if you hit, that doesn't mean he's dead.
