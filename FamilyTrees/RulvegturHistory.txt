Ljorn took interest in Swordfighting. He got his sword from the storage room. Alf took interest of a spear.

Year 966
Ljorn goes on first adventure to recover a book documenting the history of a lost civilization. Alf goes with him. There were also a couple other people. While looking for this book, a group of 12 draugr attacks the party. Alf gets cut, on the left leg, and Ljorn almost dies.
During the adventure, Ljorn discovers a tome that teaches the basics of magic, but doesn't read it. Instead, he throws it in the storage room of his home. The adventure took two months.
After Ljorn returned, Ljorn bought a new sword, and returned the other sword into the storage room.

A raid group led by Jûmlathnar Elves attacks Argonlav. The family's home nearly gets destroyed. Ljorn wanted to protect his home and make sure it would never get destroyed, so he got the old tome, and taught himself. A few months later, he joined a school of evocation in the City of Dagsvald. While at the academy, he invented a silly game where you chuck wooden beads soaked in spark potion at each other. Being hit with a bead means you're out.

After the battle ended, Ljorn and Alf both returned home.

Year 969
Ljorn decides to go on another adventure, to protect a Hendric city (not the capital city) from a dangerous group of cultists. They were paid 10gp and 1000sp each. He returned four months later. He decides to build a better house for his family, using the best materials available. Along with himself, he paid an additional 10 workers to build the house. He bought a 300gp, 9cm diameter crystal opal orb, as a new arcane focus.
