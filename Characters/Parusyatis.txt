Parusyatis

Female
Age: 35 (born 938)
Alignment: Chaotic Evil
Race:      Yellow Rat Snake Demi-Human



[[DESCRIPTION]]
Parusyatis has upturned almond, glowing yellow eyes with slit pupils similar to reptiles. She has braided black hair, and her skin is covered with a layer of resilient yellow scales. Her nails are hard and sharp, like a bear's claw, and can retracted to normal nails.

She wears a red silk dress. She is around 5'5" in height, and she has a curvaceous figure that gives off an ethereally beautiful and mesmerizing aura, contributing to her allure.

When Parusyatis bleeds, her blood is colored light red instead of dark red, and is slightly more transparent.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Parusyatis is manipulative and cunning, using her charm to control other people. She's also sadistic with a playful side, often playing on other people's emotions and watching them suffer before killing them. She is also emotionally cold, but is capable of acting convincingly vulnerable just for deception. Despite her weakness to lilies and tulips, she doesn't fear them.



[[ABILITIES]]
Parusyatis can extend her nails into sharp claws, and retract them back to normal rounded nails. Parusyatis can see in the dark and can sense whether something is poisonous or venomous by looking at it. She can also charm other people by looking them in the eye if she puts enough effort. In addition, she practices Gu magic.

Parusyatis is weak to lilies and tulips. When she touches these flowers, her energy gets drained by them. If she touches them for too long (more than several seconds), she will feel tired and sleepy.
