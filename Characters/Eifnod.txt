Currently, Eifnod is married to Myrfriss.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Eifnod has a strong sense of honor, loyal to Dagsvald and his position as jarl of Kjartkofn. He is described as bold and slightly wrathful, willing to assert control over anything he sees as disorganized.



[[ABILITIES]]
As the jarl, Eifnod learned Esrel and a bit of Hendric to communicate with foreigners, along with Dagsvaldian as his native language.

He also practices sword fighting, and is able to hold his own in against two average warriors with the same weaponry. Because his sword is usually coared in the magic grease, each strike of his sword burns whatever he slashes with a puff of flame.

Sometimes when he isn't practicing with his sword, he practices riding a horse inside his fortress.



[[LORE]]
In 961 AD during one of Dagsvald's campaigns, because of his skill, armor, and weaponry, he was chosen to lead a group to go along the northern side of the river next to Lismerlav and Argonlav. They had 40 men to go along that river to go down south. They destroyed only one bandit camp.

In 966 AD when Okrif, the current Jarl of Kjartkjofn died, Eifnod was given the new position as jarl.

Just recently, Okrif's son's son went to the jarl demanding that he should be the current jarl. Eifnod then got two guards to seize the son's son, let him off with a warning before having him be escorted out of the fortress. To the people living in villages under his domain, he is usually feared, but not as much as the king.
