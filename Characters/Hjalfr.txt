[[DESCRIPTION]]
Hjalfr is an explorer who lives in Argánlaf. He has a lean body and is around 5'8" in height. His short hair is black, his eyes are pale green, and has fair skin. His eyes are deep-set, and his gaze can be described as "withering", even though it doesn't actually do anything.

He wears a dark cloak, a muted red tunic, dark pants, a ring belt, and a pair of shoes. When in combat, he wears a chainmail hauberk and a Gjermundbu helmet. He wears a iron Talmundúr amulet.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Hjalfr is described as arrogant. He likes to talk to people but can be a little stubborn and argumentative, usually defending anything he believes until he is directly proven wrong. However he can be explorative, wanting to see something for himself rather than merely listening to stories of it. Because of his explorative personality, he is willing to join any adventuring or exploring party just to experience the "old stories".



[[ABILITIES]]
Hjalfr can speak Dagsvaldian as his native language. Hjalfr practices with a dane axe, and owns one in his home.

When Hjalfr fights with his dane axe, he is more defensive, as he would usually wait for his opponents to strike first. And if not, he would taunt them.
