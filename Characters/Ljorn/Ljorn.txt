Ljorn Rulskrod
Male
Age: 25 (born 947, December 2)
Alignment: Lawful Neutral
Ethnicity: Dagsvaldian
Race:      Human

Ljorn is a wizard from Argonlav. His hair is dark blond and wavy, is a little longer than shoulder length. His hair is combed back and wears a cloth strip around his head to keep his hair back, and he has a light stubble. His eyes are hooded, downturned and are dark pale blue, and has fair skin. Because his eyes are hooded and downturned, he may look sad or tired to some people.

He wears a woolen brown cloak held by a brooch, a long blue calf length tunic, baggy brown pants, a belt and a pair of boots. He has a baldric carrying a scabbard with a 5-lobed viking sword on his belt, and his belt carries two leather pouches. Under the baldric he carries a small seax, and a waterskin. He also carries a 7 cm wooden orb in diameter, hung on the belt in a pouch made for it, and is carried on his back side to the left. He wears a necklace of Talmundur's symbol (silver) with a bunch of labradorite and onyx beads (8 labradorite and 2 onyx to be precise). He is 178 (5' 10") centimeters tall.

His left arm is weaker than his right, because of an arrow shot on his left shoulder during a battle. The arrow resulted in a scar.

Ljorn carries around 20 silver in his coin purse.

Ljorn has some knowledge on history for the past thousand years, and he also knows about Furnalfa and Parhrüvaryg.
