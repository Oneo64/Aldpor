[[DESCRIPTION]]
Seyja is a warrior from Argánlaf. She has wavy red hair that flows to her armpits, thin eyebrows, and her eyes are green and upturned. She is 5'5" (165 centimeters) tall.

She normally wears a red dress, ring belt, and leather shoes. She also wears an iron Talmundúr amulet.

When in combat or traveling, she has a red tunic and brown pants. She will also wear a Gjermundbu helmet, a chainmail byrnie, a Viking sword in a baldric scabbard, and a round shield slung on her back.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Seyja is bold, fiery, and has a patriotic spirit for the kingdom. She likes to keep organized and tidy. She can also be analytical and strategize things before doing it.

Seyja likes to "categorize" things for fun, as she would sometimes invent random archetypes for others like a nickname. She won't actually call them by whatever she comes up with, but might tell them about it.

The way Seyja talks in English is weird. Not only she has a strong Fjallandic accent, she speaks English using Fjallandic grammar and phrases, as if the words were replaced with English words.

Seyja's favorite food is salted potatoes, roasted until the skin is semi-crispy. She has a soft spot for dogs.



[[ABILITIES]]
Seyja can speak Fjallandic and Centrumic (English). She has trained with her sword and shield, and her combat abilities are above average.
