[[ABILITIES]]
Säelrie can speak Esrel. She learned Druidic and Sylvan during druidry practice, and finally learned Centrumic (English) to talk to humans.

She has traveling experience, as many years ago she traveled to Furnalfa to retrieve an ancient Rànûladàenic tablet stolen by evil fey. She also knows how to handle animals, and has an easier time approaching them and letting them know she's friendly.

Säelrie is immune to all poison and disease, due to druidic practices. She also knows about Furnalfa.
