Säelri is described as being usually calm and patient. She likes to help others, but can be disorganized. She has little sense of money saving, and tend to spend more than she should on things like food or trivial things she finds interesting.



[[ABILITIES]]
Säelri can speak Esrel. She learned Druidic and Sylvan during druidry practice, and finally learned Hendric (English) to talk to humans.

She has traveling experience, as many years ago she traveled to Furnalfa to retrieve an ancient Rànûladàenic tablet stolen by evil fey. She also knows how to handle animals, and has an easier time approaching them and letting them know she's friendly.

Säelri is immune to all poison and disease, due to druidic practices. She also knows about Furnalfa.
