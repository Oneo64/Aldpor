Ljorn

Male
Age: 25 (born 947, December 2)
Alignment: Neutral Good
Ethnicity: Fjallander
Race:      Human



[[DESCRIPTION]]
Ljorn is a man from Argánlaf. His hair is dark blond and slightly wavy and is a little longer than shoulder length. A cloth strip tied around his head keeps his hair back, and he has a light stubble. His eyes are hooded, downturned, and dark pale blue, and has fair skin. Because his eyes are hooded and downturned, he may look sad or tired to some people. He is 175 (5'9) centimeters tall.

He wears a woolen brown cloak, a calf-length muted blue tunic, brown pants, a belt, and a pair of boots. He has a baldric carrying a scabbard with a Petersen Type L sword (5-lobed viking sword). On his belt, he has a leather pouch and a small seax under the sword baldric. He wears a necklace of an iron Talmundúr amulet, and another necklace with a single piece of labradorite.

While traveling, Ljorn has a nasal helmet, and a round shield slung over his back. He will also carry a thin grimoire (about thirty pages) that has stave-drawing and potion-brewing instructions, and a piece of coal in the pouch.

Ljorn is close friends (from childhood) with Meyrúna, and acquainted with Flokr (not exactly a friend). He can be found at his house either chopping firewood, checking his family's farm for weeds, sitting outside the door reading his spellbook, playing Plattrægnall with someone (probably with Alfr or Flokr), or help carry wood Alfr and Ulfrir have felled back to their home. Sometimes he will accompany Meyrúna into the forest as she gathers herbs.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Ljorn is usually kind, reserved, and slightly introverted. He doesn't like getting himself involved in the affairs of others. He is also stubborn, and sometimes rather not take any suggestions that changes what or how he want to do something. Ljorn has a slight paranoia of deep forests, which was because he saw a draugr in one at the age of 10.

The way he talks in English is weird. Not only he has a strong Fjallandic accent, he speaks English using Fjallandic grammar and phrases, as if the words were replaced with English words. When he gets frustrated, he would quietly use strong language under his breath but doesn't use extreme insults.

He enjoys venison, and would carry dried strips of some of it in his pouch for later.



[[ABILITIES]]
Ljorn usually fights with a sword and shield, and his combat abilities are average. He is also proficient at drawing magical staves and brewing potions.

Ljorn's native language is Fjallandic, but he can also speak Centrumic (English) and Esrel. He knows how to play Plattrægnall, a local board game.

Ljorn has combat experience from raiding an old castle ruins, where he fought a couple of draugar. Because he was shot in the shoulder with an arrow during a centaur raid, his left arm was weakened.
