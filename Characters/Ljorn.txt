Ljorn

Male
Age: 25 (born 947, December 2)
Alignment: Neutral Good
Ethnicity: Dagsvaldian
Race:      Human



[[DESCRIPTION]]
Ljorn is a man from Argánlaf. His hair is dark blond and slightly wavy and is a little longer than shoulder length. A cloth strip tied around his head keeps his hair back, and he has a light stubble. His eyes are hooded, downturned, and dark pale blue, and has fair skin. Because his eyes are hooded and downturned, he may look sad or tired to some people. He is 175 (5'9) centimeters tall.

He wears a woolen brown cloak held by a brooch, a long muted blue tunic (calf-length), baggy brown pants, a belt, and a pair of boots. He has a baldric carrying a scabbard with a Petersen Type L sword (5-lobed viking sword). On his belt, he has a leather pouch and a small seax under the sword baldric. He wears a necklace of an iron Talmundúr amulet.

While traveling, Ljorn has a nasal helmet, and a round shield slung over his back.

He carries a grimoire, a piece of labradorite, and a piece of coal in the pouch.

Ljorn is friends with Flokr, and close friends (from childhood) with Meyrúna. He can be found at his house either chopping firewood, checking his family's farm for weeds, sitting outside the door reading his spellbook, playing Plattrægnall with someone (probably with Alfr or Flokr), or help carry wood Alfr and Ulfrir have felled back to their home. Sometimes he will accompany Meyrúna into the forest as she gathers herbs.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Ljorn is usually kind, reserved and introverted, as he would rather be alone or with people close to him. He doesn't like getting himself involved in the affairs of others. He is also stubborn, and sometimes rather not take any suggestions that changes what or how he want to do something. Ljorn has a slight paranoia of deep forests, which was because he saw a draugr in one at the age of 10.

The way he talks in English is weird. Not only he has a strong Dagsvaldian accent, he speaks English using Dagsvaldian grammar and phrases, as if the words were replaced with English words. When he gets frustrated, he would quietly use strong language under his breath but doesn't use extreme insults.

He enjoys venison, and would carry dried strips of some of it in his pouch for later.



[[ABILITIES]]
Ljorn's native language is Dagsvaldian, but he can also speak Hendric (English), and Esrel. He learned Esrel and Hendric from the Academy of Aldorim. He knows how to play Plattrægnall, a local board game.

Ljorn usually fights with a sword and shield. He could be described as just average with the weapons, or perhaps below average because of his weak left arm.

He has combat experience from raiding and old castle ruins, where he fought a couple of draugar. He also participated in a battle before he returned from the Academy of Aldorim, fighting against the Kingdom of Yûmlathnar. But because he was shot in the shoulder with an arrow during the battle, his left arm was weakened.

Having studied one year in the Academy of Aldorim, he knows how to cast some arcane spells. He also learned how to brew some potions, which are: Bastard's Poison, Calming Salve, Curing Tonic, Nontoxic Seizure Concoction, Regeneration Potion.
