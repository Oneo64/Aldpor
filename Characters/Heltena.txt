[[DESCRIPTION]]
Heltena is a seer-elf from the town of Irbal√ªind, Esrelu. She has long flowing brown hair, golden pupilless eyes, and pale skin. Like all cold elves, her earlobes are long.

She wears a white cloak, a long brown dress with yellow embroidery at the hem, a belt, and a pair of shoes. She has an amber bead bracelet on her right wrist, and a jade and amber bead bracelet on her left. She has a sheathed dagger on her belt.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Heltena is reserved and doesn't speak much. She's a bit introverted and pessimistic too, and often prefers to read someone's omens from afar before approaching them.



[[ABILITIES]]
Heltena is a seeress, meaning she practices Seidr. She also practices knife-throwing in her free time and can get her knife to stick to the wall every time, but she sucks at aiming. She can also only speak her native tongue, Esrel.
