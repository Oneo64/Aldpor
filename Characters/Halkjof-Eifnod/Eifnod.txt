Eifnod is the current Jarl of Kjartkjofn. He was born in Skjorknauz, a village north of Kvappavanin and southwest of Ãžuryngard.

He has red wavy hair and a full beard, a birthmark on his right cheek. His eyes are heterochromic, which are green with it's center being brown. He wears a yellow cloak, a chainmail hauberk, brown tunic that has tan embroirdery and a split down it's middle, baggy brown pants, a buckled belt, and a pair of boots. He has a baldric scabbard, that has a Petersen Type L sword (5-lobed viking sword).

His sword is usually coated with a layer of Iron Grease of Magic (fire).

In 961 AD during one of Dagsvald's campaigns, because of his skill, armor, and weaponry, he was chosen to lead a group to go along the northern side of the river next to Lismerlav and Argonlav. They had 40 men to go along that river to go down south. They destroyed only one bandit camp.

In 966 AD when Okrif, the current Jarl of Kjartkjofn died, Eifnod was given the new position as jarl.

Just recently, Okrif's son's son went to the jarl demanding that he should be the current jarl. Eifnod then got two guards to seize the son's son, let him off with a warning before having him be escorted out of the fortress. To the people living in villages under his domain, he is usually feared, but not as much as the king.

Currently, Eifnod is married to Myrfriss.
