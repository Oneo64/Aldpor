[[PERSONALITY]]
As a knight, Hammin is loyal to Randúlfr as in honor. He is also an extrovert, as he likes to talk and usually acts as a front for Randúlfr. Hammin would act caring to people he sees as vulnerable, especially physically. However he doesn't like centaurs, and may jump to conclusions without much thought.

He has strong Dagsvaldian accent, and speaks English weirdly. When speaking in English, he speaks English using Dagsvaldian grammar and phrases, as if the words were replaced with English words.



[[ABILITIES]]
Hammin can speak Dagsvaldian as his native language. He can also speak some Hendric (English) even though it isn't fluent. He practices combat with a sword and shield, and knows how to ride horses. He can also play the board game Plattrægnall.
