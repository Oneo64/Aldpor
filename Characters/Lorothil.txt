[[DESCRIPTION]]
Loroðil is a wizard from Básrynga. He has shoulder-length dark blond wavy hair. His eyes are dark blue, and he has fair skin.

He wears a blue triangular fur hat on his head, with a woolen brown cloak, a long muted blue tunic with tan accents, brown pants, a belt and a pair of boots. He also has a silver amulet in the shape of Talmundúr's symbol, and another amulet which is a piece of sapphire. His belt carries two leather pouches.

Loroðil lives in an isolated longhouse two kilometers north of Básrynga. Every day, he can be seen walking to the main village and wandering around the market area, then back to his longhouse.

He is 178 (5'10) centimeters tall.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Loroðil can be described as observant and analytical, being able to spot any hint of deception and make out the true intentions of people faster than anyone. He also feels some responsibility towards his town village, but when he is forced to do something he really doesn't like, he would find a workaround or find some excuse to not do that. He is also somewhat quiet, as he is introverted and will only speak when needed to.

Loroðil has this small obsession with purchasing small figurines and trinkets, as he likes to try and infuse them with magic through potion-soaking.



[[ABILITIES]]
Loroðil's mother tongue is Dagsvaldian. He also learned Rànûdan and Centrumic (English) so he could talk to foreigners. He also learned Primordial because it is required to learn magic, and also learned Abyssal to study demons.

He has practiced magic for eleven years, and also studied it at an academy for three years. During his time in the academy, he learned advanced potion brewing.
