[[LORE]]
[956 AD]
Àlantre took horse riding.

[957 AD]
Evil fey launched gvarth attacks on Rànûdel after King Vasolas denied to help them. Àlantre's family used half their silver to buy 20 moonshrooms and 5 amethyst gorbries, and fled up to Vuntarla, which was the closest elvish kingdom other than Rànûdel, to try and get as far away from Rànûdel as possible.

[958 AD]
One and a half months later, Àlantre's family arrived at Vuntarla. They sold their moonshrooms and amethyst gorbries for a good price, and got a small house with the silver.
