In combat he wears a magical leather nasal helmet, which grants him a slight darkvision when worn. While traveling or going into combat, he has a round shield that's painted brown with a white cross.

When his father takes his boat to trade, Baulnir usually goes with him to guard the boat.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Baulnir is protective of his family, and may feel protectiveness to people he sees as morally good and vulnerable. However he can be arrogant, thinking his fighting is better than how it is.



[[ABILITIES]]
Baulnir can speak Dagsvaldian, and because of trading he picked up some Hendric (English). Still, he isn't fluent in English.

Many years ago, he gained some experience from raiding a castle ruins with his sister and another two warriors from Argonlav. Later, he gained some more from defending his home village from a bandit raid.

He sports a sword and shield, since he practiced it over the past four years.
