He is 173 (5'8) centimeters tall.

Flokr is acquainted with Ljorn (not exactly a friend).

He can be found at his house either checking his family's farm for weeds, playing Plattrægnall with someone (probably with Ljorn), inside his house brewing potions, wandering in the local markets, or wandering in the forest for whatever reason (most likely looking for potion ingredients).



[[PERSONALITY]]
Flokr is mostly calm and generous. But usually, when sometimes when deciding to act he can be hesitant and think about whether he should do it or not. He is also reserved, not talking to others as much as his family and friends.

He has strong Dagsvaldian accent, and speaks English weirdly. When speaking in English, he speaks English using Dagsvaldian grammar and phrases, as if the words were replaced with English words.



[[ABILITIES]]
Flokr's native language is Dagsvaldian. During his time in the Academy of Aldorim, he learned Hendric (English) and Primordial. He has practiced magic for five years, three spent in the academy. He also learned to brew potions, and can brew potions labeled as advanced.

He also plays Plattrægnall.
