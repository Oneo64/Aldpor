Dagnir

Male
Age: 48 (born 925)
Alignment: Neutral
Ethnicity: Fjallander
Race:      Human



[[DESCRIPTION]]
Dagnir has long black wavy hair, a full messy beard, and dark eyes. He has slight wrinkles due to old age. He lives in the western area of Arg√°nlaf.

He wears a dark brown cloak, a dark yellow tunic, dark pants, a belt, and a pair of boots. He carries a sheathed seax on his belt.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Dagnir is devious and sometimes reckless, yet shows cowardice to things he doesn't understand (like magic) or people with political power. Despite his cowardice, he doesn't fear small insects like centipedes or roaches, and would pick them up and throw them away if needed. For some reason, he talks faster than others.



[[ABILITIES]]
Dagnir is proficient in stealth, gained from sneaking around at night. He can also swim well, even if he has something weighing him down. He can also throw knives and get them to land on a wall if he's standing at the same distance away as when he practices.
