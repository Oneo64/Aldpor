[[DESCRIPTION]]
Þrein is a human from Lismerlav. He has grey eyes, pale skin, and short light brown hair. His face has a minimal amount of freckles, and his skin is slightly wrinkled.

Þrein wears a brown triangular fur cap, a muted aqua (blueish green) tunic with brown accents, baggy brown pants, a belt, and a pair of boots. He has a 12-inch seax sheathed on his belt, and a coin purse. He wears an iron Talmundur amulet.

Þrein is the father of Ennu and Baulnir. Þrein also works as a fish trader, and owns a karve. He trades along the Argolav-Lismerlav route, and Baulnir usually goes with him.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Þrein is described as having a good heart, and is protective of his family. He also has a keen eyesight from hunting experience. However he may be somewhat impulsive, and paranoid of his own ship being stolen by thieves.

He has strong Dagsvaldian accent, and speaks English weirdly. When speaking in English, he speaks English using Dagsvaldian grammar and phrases, as if the words were replaced with English words.



[[ABILITIES]]
Þrein is a trader, who owns a karve and knows how to control that boat. Because of his occupation as a trader, he is able to speak both Dagsvaldian and Hendric (English). He's also proficient with a longbow, since when there is no fish to trade, he usually hunts deer for sport and food.
