Jorvas was a human, born in 522 AD in a Galabric town, 200 years after the Kingdom of Galabrus's collapse. He and 3 other nobles traveled north with a group of men, but was killed in battle by bandits. Later, he returned as a draugr, and now resides inside his tomb. Like all corpses, Jorvas has blueish grey skin, completely white eyes, and his hair is sparse and gray. He is 190 (6'3) centimeters tall.

He has a deep, open cut across the right side of his neck, which is a sign of a failed beheading.

He wears a migration period helmet, lined with brass and lead. He also wears a worn cloak, chainmail hauberk, gambeson, pants, a belt and a pair of shoes. His chainmail hauberk is battered and torn, and the torn areas have visible skin that is wounded with cuts and slashes from spears, arrows, swords, axes, etc. He also has a scabbard containing a spatha, and a round shield. The colors of his clothing have faded, so it all looks just dull and grey.

Like all draugr, his voice is raspy and deep.
