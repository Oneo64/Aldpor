While wandering in the forest, Fraldr, Gorðr and Lalfrel sees the draugr Haldigr I walking far away. They weren't able to see who it was, or know that it was Haldigr I. They quickly escape, saying that they saw a "cloaked man who was evil". They returned without a scratch, and told the rest of the family.

Two days later, Ljorn saw the same draugr just outside the forest during nighttime. He hid back into his home when Haldigr I turned to look at the village, thinking the draugr saw him. Because of this, he has been paranoid whenever he's inside a forest, especially boreal ones.

While in the woods cutting a tree down, Alfr and Ulfrir were almost crushed by a tree, but it was stopped by another tree. During this incident, Ulfrir was grazed by a falling fir cone.

Alfr agrees and goes with him to guard over the karve.

During his guarding, Alfr caught two bandits skulking around looking to steal something. Alfr tried chasing the bandits, but they disappeared into the forest. Þrein heard of this, and decided to give five coppers instead of three after seeing the footprints of bare feet near the coast where his boat was.

After a week, Alfr returns to his family's home, with the coppers promised.
