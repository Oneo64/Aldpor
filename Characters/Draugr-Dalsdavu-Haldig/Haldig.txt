Haldig I was a human, born in 788 AD in Argonlav. At 30 years old, he traveled down to Tarib with a handful of explorers. Halfway there, he encountered a daeva tribe, and was slain by them. He did not receive a proper burial. Many years later, he became a draugr who roams freely in the world. Haldig I has old, blueish grey skin, completely white eyes, and his hair is shoulder-length and grey. He is 178 (5'10) centimeters tall.

He wears a worn deer hide cloak, a rusted nasal helmet, a worn faded red tunic, faded brown pants, a belt and a pair of shoes. He carries a dane axe, and uses it to walk as a walking stick.
