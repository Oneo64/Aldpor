Thuumikishu is a dwarven seer from Banod, and got lost after he came down from the mountain. He has long, messy white hair, and a long messy beard. His eyes are brown, and his skin is very pale and slightly dark. He has a worn boar hide cloak, brown tunic, dark brown pants, a belt, and a pair of shoes. His belt is holding an unsheathed obsidian knife. He is 130 centimeters tall. He wears two necklaces, one necklace is a jade and malachite beaded necklace, the other is an amber beaded necklace decorated with wolf fangs.

He carries a plain straight stick as a walking stick.
