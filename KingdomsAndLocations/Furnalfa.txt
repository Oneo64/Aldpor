Furnalfa is a plane of fey, or more commonly known as Realm of Pure Nature. It is a never ending dark forest of crooked oak, covered in green moss. The ground is covered with plants, ferns, short grass, and sometimes, rocks. Most of these oaks do not have leaves, and if they do, it is very little, and the leaves are orange. Some areas are brighter than others, and sometimes there are clearings.

Inhabitants: Centaur, Dryad, Satyr.
