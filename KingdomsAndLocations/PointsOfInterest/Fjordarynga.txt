[[SETTLEMENT]]
Fjorðarynga is a village built on a fjord west of Fjalland, fifty meters above sea level. It's isolated except for a "bridge" that connects this fjord to the mainland.

Fjorðarynga has a ship harbor at the sea. There is a path that leads down to the harbor. Halfway to the harbor along this path, there is a grove of towering pines and no undergrowth. The path is lined with torches on both sides that provide a source of light. Two guards patrol this path, and another two watch the harbor.

The natural bridge connecting the fjord to the mainland has a wooden wall, with four guards stationed on the wall. The guards have a small blowing horn.

Every morning the horn is blown once continuously to signal safety. When a threat is seen, they blow twice with the second blow longer than the first.



[[SPECIFIC BELIEFS]]
Grove: The grove is believed to be the home of three dryads. Harming or burning a tree can get you a slash across the palm of your hand. Continuous burning or destruction will get you a beating, exile, or removal of a finger.



[[LOCAL TRADING]]
Rye is mainly grown here because it is resistant to the cold and can grow in poor soil. Traders trade rye, tuna, and salmon with other settlements for things like iron and other resources.
