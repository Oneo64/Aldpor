[[BELIEFS/MISCONCEPTIONS]]
	Fjallanders: 	A lot of them don't like Fjallanders, seeing them as barbaric or uncivilized. They also see them as purely warriors, without magic or access to magic.
	Northern Elves: Same as Fjallanders, but not with as much dislike.
	Trolls:         A common belief is that trolls find enjoyment in watching sexual intercourse of other races (this is false of course). This leads them to loathe trolls.
	Elves:          Another common belief is that moon elves have cold blood and are nocturnal.
