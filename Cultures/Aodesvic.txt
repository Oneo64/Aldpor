Aesthetic/base: Roman, Norman



[[BELIEFS/MISCONCEPTIONS]]
	Dagsvaldians:   Controversial. Some of them don't like Dagsvaldians, while some find them "romantic", the main focus of them being described as barbaric or uncivilized.
	Northern Elves: Same as Dagsvaldians, but with less emphasis on the barbaric and uncivilized part.
	Trolls:         A common belief is that trolls are weirdly flirtatious (this is false of course).
	Elves:          Another common belief is that moon elves have cold blood and are nocturnal.
