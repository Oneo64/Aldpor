[[BELIEFS/MISCONCEPTIONS]]
	Fjallanders: 	Controversial. Some of them don't like Fjallanders, while some find them "romantic", the main focus of them being described as barbaric or uncivilized. They also see them as purely warriors, without magic or access to magic.
	Northern Elves: Same as Fjallanders, but with less emphasis on the barbaric and uncivilized part.
	Trolls:         A common belief is that trolls are weirdly flirtatious (this is false of course).
	Elves:          Another common belief is that moon elves have cold blood and are nocturnal.
