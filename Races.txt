Races found in my world:

Ranastar:
	Ranastars are anthropomorphic animals, like furries, but they make more sense.
	When a person is obsessed with nature and they mate with someone else, the offspring has a 10% chance to be a ranastar. Ranastars born this way need to wait a few years before transformation.
	If a ranastar mates with one of it's kind, the offspring will always be a ranastar.

	Most ranastars will run away from home and live in the wild, or stay sheltered at home. This is because they feel out of place, the commonfolk bully them for their appearance.
	Bear and rat ranastars prefer to stay with the commonfolk and feel no shame, while bobcat ranastars tend to go alone.

	Classes: Barbarians, fighters, rogues and druids are most common, while everything else are rare.
