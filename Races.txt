Races found in my world:

Ranastar:
	Ranastars are literally just animals that stand on their hind legs, created by natural manifestations of LÃ»nanyr. When a person is obsessed with nature and they mate with someone else, the offspring has a 10% chance to be a ranastar. Ranastars born this way will appear normal, but will begin transformation almost immedietely. The transformation takes up to a year.

	Most ranastars will run away from home and live in the wild, or stay sheltered at home. This is because they feel out of place, the commonfolk shame, or depise them for their appearance. However, certain variants are not treated as harshly, such as the bear. Because of this, the shamed and despised often develop a hatred, or anger for intelligent beings and the certain variants said before.
