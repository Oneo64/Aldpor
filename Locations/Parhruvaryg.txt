Parhrüvaryg is a dimension similar to Vorasil. It is an endless world of purple glittering liquid, which is the magic of the world. The liquid is most commonly known as Parhrügi’s Tears. Parhrügi’s Tears are extremely volatile, and the speaking of Primordial alters this liquid. If brought back to Talygva, a single vial would be worth tens of gold.
