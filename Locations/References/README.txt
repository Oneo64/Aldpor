All images shown here are NOT the exact locations, but instead they should be interpreted as brief references of how they SHOULD look/feel like. But one thing that must not be ignored are details on the focus of the image. If the actual descriptions of the reference contradicts what is shown in the image (says something other than what is shown), then the image is inaccurate and should not be considered as true.

Examples:
	- A house that is shown with a turf roof
	- A forest with a specific undergrowth thickness
	- The main gate to a city where it has a specific defensive design e.g. two towers on either side, or a roofed structure above the entrance

	- In "Moon Shrine.jpg", the structure is NOT 20 meters high, and is NOT made of large limestone bricks. But because the descriptions for the moon shrines say so, you shouldn't think moon shrines as less than 20 meters and made of clay bricks.
