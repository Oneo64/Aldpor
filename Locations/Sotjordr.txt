Sotvaryg is the Plane of Earth and Stone. It appears to be ginormous desolate cavern, made of stone and hard earth, with occasional openings on the ceiling to the outside. Near these openings where the sunlight gets in, will be small blotches of trees and flowers. The outside is extremely mountainous and inhabitable.
