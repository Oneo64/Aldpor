ÞURYNGARD RING FORTRESS
======================================================================================================================================================

This castle is a large ring fortress made of stone, built on the top of a hill. The castle contains a city made of three towns: Þalmundrynga, Kasgjenðil, and Vilsnagur. The outer wall has a diameter of about 500 meters. The inner wall is built on higher terrain, which is elevated up about 6 meters.
The inner wall is approximately 100 meters. There are three buildings inside, where the king's house is built to the back, it's side facing the main gate while two smaller ones are built on the side. They are made of stone instead of wood.

The outer wall wall is much farther from the ring fortress, which fits three towns (or districts). The houses in these districts are made taller and larger, unlike the village houses. These houses did not require additional support beams that were on an angle. The outer walls are about 6 meters high. Outside the outer walls, are surrounded by a boreal forest.

In the inner ring, there is a large longhouse built with mostly stone, except for the roof and the top triangle wall part of the roof. The ring of the castle is generally reserved for only the king, his family, guards, and nobles).

There are 20 guards patrolling the outer ring, 20 guards patrolling the towns, 10 archers/lookouts, and 15 king's guards. There are also to watch towers with thatched roofs, 10 meters up instead of 6. To get up there is a ladder at the back of the watch towers, and each tower is stationed one archer.
