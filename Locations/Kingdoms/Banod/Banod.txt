The castle of Banod is a fortress built on a peak on a steep, snowy mountain. It's outer walls are made of stone, while the structures inside are wooden. The main entrance is a road up the mountain with some carved stairs on the steep parts. The castle also extends down into the ground about 30 meters, making extra space. The underground is usually used for markets more commercial things like shops and inns since it doesn't get too snowy there in the winter. The houses underground are also made of wood. (think Edinburgh Castle, but it's surrounded by lower mountains and the walls are made of wood)
