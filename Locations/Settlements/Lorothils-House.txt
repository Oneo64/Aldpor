Loroðil's House

Location:       Basrynga



[[DESCRIPTION]]
Loroðil's house is a longhouse, built for the wizard Loroðil. Normally longhouses are built for many people, but in this house the extra living space has been turned into space for various things for research such as books, shelves of fermenting and pickling ingredients, empty space with a straw dummy for spell experimentation, and others.
