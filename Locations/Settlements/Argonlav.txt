[[LANDSCAPE]]
Argonlav built on grasslands, south of Dagsvald. About 80 meters to the west is the edge of the Southern Dagsvaldian Forest, with a dirt path that leads into the forest. About 30 meters south there is a wide, meter-and-a-half deep river with a wooden bridge built across. 



[[LOCAL TRADING]]
Traders usually take a boat along the southern river, to trade wood for fish with Lismerlav, which is a long way to the east where there is farther away from any forest.
