Population:     150 people
Current hersir: Rand√∫lfr



[[SETTLEMENT]]
The houses of the village are built together. In the northeast of the village where it is farther from the forest and river, there are two large longhouses built side by side, one built for the hersir's family, and the second one being the community hall where meetings are held. There is also an iron bell built into the community hall, rung when an important meeting is required. Usually when there is a raid, the bell and a war horn is sounded at the same time.

In the forest next to the village is the ruins of a 150 year old longhouse, that was abandoned after the sighting of a troll wandering in the forest. The ruins is in a small opening grown over by grass and bushes, now its rotten framing is all that is left.



[[LANDSCAPE]]
Argonlav built on grasslands, south of Dagsvald. About 80 meters to the west is the edge of the Southern Dagsvaldian Forest where bushes are more prevalent the closer you are to the edge, with a dirt path that leads into the forest. About 30 meters south there is a wide, meter-and-a-half deep river with a wooden bridge built across. There are almost no flowers present on the grasslands, the only ones being white flowers that are faintly scattered across the landscape.

The dirt path that leads into the forest is rather thin and wild, being about a meter wide as it wasn't a road that connected to any settlement. Instead, it connects to the abandoned longhouse ruins.



[[LOCAL TRADING]]
Traders usually take a boat along the southern river, to trade wood and berries for fish with Lismerlav, which is a long way to the east where it is farther away from forestry.
