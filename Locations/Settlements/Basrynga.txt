[[SETTLEMENT]]
There are about 15 house in Basrynga, built scattered around a low hill. On top of this low hill there is a longhouse, which is the hersir's house.

There is a thin path to the southwest that leads to a well, covered with a wooden cover to prevent snow from entering and to stop water from freezing over. Around the middle the path splits into two, where the other goes to a small patch of pine trees.

To the north another thin path leads up another hill higher than this one, where a longhouse sits isolated 2 kilometers away from the village, which is Loroðil's dwelling.

At the immediate outskirts there is a watchtower built next to the path to the well, and another watchtower built next to the path leading towards the north. One guard is stationed at each watchtower, each guard equipped with a war horn.

In the village around ten guards patrol around.



[[LANDSCAPE]]
Basrynga is built ontop of a low hill, which is part of a desolate plains where little grass and trees grows. This low hill has some large rocks scattered around.

The only trees is a small patch five kilometers away to the west, which consists of around a thousand pine trees.



[[LOCAL TRADING]]
Rye is mainly grown here, because it is resistant to the cold and can grow in poor soil. Traders trade rye with other settlements for things like iron and other resources.
