[[SETTLEMENT]]
There are about 15 house in Basrynga, built scattered around a low hill. On top of this low hill there is a longhouse built next to two smaller houses, which is the hersir's house and areas for his farm animals.

There is a thin path to the southwest that leads to a well, covered with a wooden cover to prevent snow from entering and to stop water from freezing over. Around the middle the path splits into two, where the other goes to a small patch of pine trees. To the north another thin path leads up another hill higher than this one, where a longhouse sits isolated 2 kilometers away from the village, which is Loroðil's dwelling.

At the immediate outskirts there is a watchtower built next to the path to the well, and another watchtower built next to the path leading towards the north. One guard is stationed at each watchtower, each guard equipped with a war horn. In the village around five guards patrol around.

Next to the house, there is another two houses, one for cattle and one for Skaðfir's horse. Each house, including Skaðfir's house, has one guard to stand beside the doors.
