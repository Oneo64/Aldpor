Kjartkjofn

Kingdom:      Dagsvald
Current jarl: Eifnod



[[SETTLEMENT]]
Kjartkjofn is a viking ring fortress, about a hundred meters in diameter. The walls has around five archers patrolling around, each with a war horn to blow when a threat is seen. About ten guards patrol the inside of the fortress, and 15 servants doing their jobs.

Outside the walls are a couple acres of farms, surrounded by a twig fence to keep out animals. Three groups of two guards patrol the farms, making sure nothing skulks around or tries to ruin the farm.

Distress signals inside the fortress, which are two "bonfire huts", which is a hut designed to hold a bonfire without interference from the rain or wind, and still allow smoke to leave by an opening in the ceiling. When one bonfire is lit, that means all is well. When two bonfires are lit, that means there is a threat.



[[LANDSCAPE]]
Kjartkjofn is built inside the Southern Dagsvaldian Forest.
