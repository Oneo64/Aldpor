[[OVERVIEW]]
Magics:
	- Druidic magic is basically wizard magic without study and using fey magic instead of directly accessing the Plane of Magic. Incantations are spoken in Druidic.

	- Seer magic is when you take the essence of Lünanyr or Hirulfyr to make magic.
	- Some people are innately seers by leaning towards Lünanyr or Hirulfyr, such as Vielthöri Aldriàndel.

	- Sorcery is when you can make simple magic happen by whim, by being magically attuned to Jalfar.

	- Scroll magic is when you access the Plane of Magic by reading a chant from a scroll (usually Primordial), with a simple gesture in your other hand. Scroll magic can only contain sorcery magic.

	- Wizard magic is when you access the Plane of Magic by speaking in Primordial, doing gestures, and holding materials.

	- People who are born magically attuned to a god are rare, being around one in a million (literally, no pun intended).

Wizards have a lot of spells, but unlike druids, seers, and sorcerers, some of their spells must be woven first before speaking the incantation.
Sorcerers can ignore the Verbal and Material components ONLY for spells marked as 'basic' or 'minor'.

Here's an example of a wizard casting the classic Fireball spell: "The man in the dark brown tunic started to wave his fingers around a small area in front of his chest. A blob of blue started to appear around his hands, connecting them like a spider web. In no time, he had finished the casting. "Xòk-al." He pushed the aura forwards as it turned into a ball of flame, and it shot forwards at a high speed, engulfing the zombies in a ball of fire."

Components:
	V = Verbal (wizards and seers chant in Primordial, druids chant in either Druidic or Sylvan, sorcerers don't need to chant)
	S = Somatic (weaving the spell, doing some ritual shit like drawing circles or coating in powder, any magic other than wizard/arcane magic uses SG instead)
	SG = Somatic gesture (simply pointing, touching, reaching, waving, wrist flicking, etc)
	M = Material

Magic spells reference (including shapechange animals):
	<10:   Starting
	10-20: Average
	21-25: Above average
	26-29: Strong
	30+:   Master



[[PARHRÜVARYG/PLANE OF MAGIC]]
This plane is an infinite dimension of just magic catalysts. By using wizard magic, you are accessing these catalysts, and making them do things according to the Primordial incantations, gestures, and materials you are holding.



[[VISUALS]]
Visuals of most magic are extremely simple and subtle, and will be just either flashes of light, glowing, auras, mists, or something elemental. Unless the spell specifies and explains the visual effect of the spell, it will have no visual effect and the spell effect simply happens.

For example: The spell Etherealness does not specify any visuals, therefore when someone casts Etherealness they simply just fade out and enter the ethereal plane.

When magic force is specified but it doesn't specify a color, then it follows these rules:
	- Minor spells looks like a faintly spectral or shimmering white color.
	- Basic magic looks like a faintly spectral or shimmering light blue color.
	- Major magic looks like a shimmering blue color.
	- Powerful magic looks like an intense blue color.



[[CLASSES/TIERS]]
Minor magic:
	- Magic that doesn't require much study (little to no knowledge of a target)
	- Less than 4 days of study and practice to learn
	- Most attacks equivalent to a punch - a few punches, does little damage to wood shields, safe behind one
	- Pure magical force is faintly visible, colored white
	- Can be cast indefinitely

Basic magic:
	- Magic that requires a moderate amount of study (brief to some knowledge of a target)
	- 4 days - 2 weeks of study and practice to learn
	- Most attacks equivalent to a weapon's hit to the chest, does some damage to wood shields, probably safe behind one
	- Pure magical force is faintly visible, colored white or blue
	- Can be cast 100 times before resting (more than 30 minutes of rest)

Major magic:
	- Magic that require a lot of study (biologist/scientist level knowledge of a target)
	- 2 weeks - 1 month of study and practice to learn
	- Most attacks equivalent to three weapon's hit to the chest, does lots of damage to shields, probably best not to try and block with a shield
	- Pure magical force is colored blue
	- Can be cast 10 times before resting (more than 30 minutes of rest)

Powerful magic:
	- Magic that is very powerful (probably the same as major magic plus maybe some philosophical things)
	- More than 1 month of study and practice to learn
	- Most attacks could one hit or two hit humanoid races, could possible just obliterate wooden shields, just don't get hit and you're fine
	- Pure magical force is very visible, colored blue
	- Can be cast 5 times before resting (more than 6 hours of rest)


Study (in the spell description if it says so) means something you have brief experience/knowledge (like how we know dogs wag their tails as sign of happiness) unless the spell description says otherwise. If the "brief" knowledge is a creature or animate thing, then you must also have basic knowledge of it's anatomy (something like how cows have 4 stomachs or parts of stomach).

Druids and Sorcerers are not required to study extensively for spells like Magic Circle or Protection from Evil and Good.

For druids, instead of a blue magic color, it is colored green. For seers it is a yellow color.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greater Restoration (major)
	Casting time: 30 seconds

	Requirements: V, S, M (a handful of cobweb)
	Duration:     1 hour

A blue mist forms around the body of a creature you touch, which will cause them to resist all sorts of attacks that do not directly target the mind, life, or soul. The armor is like four or five layers of thick clothing, except that the clothing isn't visible, doesn't block heat, and doesn't feel like anything as it is only a force.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magic Circle (major)
	Casting time: 20 seconds
	Range:        touch
	Requirements: V, S, M (a chalk and glass powder which the spell consumes)

Until the spell ends, a target you touch is immune to charming or possession from any of the following creatures you have studied before: celestials, fiends, fey. If the target is already charmed or possessed, then the target is able to break out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purify Food and Drink (basic)
	Casting time: instantaneous
	Range:        touch
	Requirements: V, S, M (a small piece of jade)

Lesser Restoration (basic)
	Casting time: 30 seconds
	Range:        touch
	Requirements: V, S

You touch a creature and can end either one disease or poison afflicting it. You must have studied the disease or poison, and must know how it works before you cast the spell.

Shield (basic)
	Casting time: instantaneous
	Range:        N/A
	Requirements: V, SG
	Duration:     2 seconds

A faint white bowl-like shape 1 meter in diameter pops out of your fist for a couple of seconds, blocking any direct strikes as if the shield was solid glass.

If something huge or heavy (like a catapult rock, falling bricks, or a really powerful blunt attack) hits this, the spectral shield shatters into shards, providing no protection. The shards dissipate harmlessly.

If the shield appears and overlaps something else, then that something else is unaffected by this spell and can pass through as it there was nothing there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Symbol (powerful)
	Casting time: 30 seconds
	Range:        touch
	Requirements: V, S, M (a chalk dipped in ink which the spell consumes)
	Duration:     until dispelled, triggered, or destroyed

You pick a general description that would match one target for this spell, like "a man wearing a red surcoat", "people not wearing shoes", "people with black hair", "any elemental", or "anyone that isn't me". You dip the coal in the ink then draw a magical symbol on a dry surface, which the symbol then fades until it is almost invisible.

When a target is detected within a 10 meters, the symbol takes 10 seconds to charge up, which it starts to glow brighter. If the target leaves the 10 meter radius, the symbol returns to normal. When it reaches 10 seconds, it disappears with a flash of white light and a popping noise, and the target is affected by the effect of this symbol.

The symbol can be destroyed by pouring or splashing magical water on it.

When casting the spell, you can choose the effects of this symbol:
	Disarmament:
		A faint white light flashes at the hands of the target. Any objects held by the target jumps out of their hand and falls towards the ground towards this symbol.

	Enchantment:
		A thought is forced into the mind of the target that their allies might be plotting against them.

	Paralysis:
		The target must resist a paralysis wave. If the target doesn't or cannot resist, they become paralyzed for five minutes and fall limp.

	Scorching:
		A cloud of hot fire bursts towards the target.

	Suspension:
		The target must resist a wave of numbness. If the target doesn't or cannot resist, they become paralyzed and held in the air for five minutes.

		A target in range that can see this stave gains a boost to their strength and durability, and they are unable to be frightened for the next hour.
	
	Fright:
		A target in range that can see this stave is frightened for the next five minutes.
	
	Repel Dead:

		Instead of a specific target, this stave has 5 charges. When a projectile enter the range of this stave that is going towards the stave, and the stave can "see" the projectile, it uses up a charge and blocks the projectile with a white shimmering shield.

		The shield appears and disappears just quick enough to block the projectile. When all charges are expended, the stave fades and becomes a non-magical drawing.

The stave's magic will be active until the drawing is destroyed, or dispelled. The rune cannot be washed away by mundane water, but other liquids like oil, tar, or magical water can.

In order to draw a stave, you must have studied either some Primordial, Druidic, Sylvan or Sylvendric.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Infuse Scroll (powerful)
	Casting time: 10 minutes
	Range:        touch

	Duration:     until dispelled or destroyed

Using a mixture of 50% Parhrügi's Tears and 50% ink, you use this to write 'scroll make' translated into Primordial, followed by a direct translation of the spell name. Do this for another two languages, Sylvan and Druidic.

Once done, you use both hands to hold the scroll open, one hand holding either side of the scroll (must be gripping it). Then you can cast this spell to infuse it in.

When the scroll is activated, the spell whose incantation is written in takes effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intricate Runic Staves (powerful)
	Casting time: 5 minutes
	Range:        30 meters
	Requirements: V, S, M (a vial of water spiritually aligned or attuned to Parhrügi and a piece of coal which is consumed on use)
	Duration:     until dispelled or destroyed

You pick a general description that would match one target for this spell, like "a man wearing a red surcoat", "people not wearing shoes", "people with black hair", "any elemental", or "anyone that isn't me". You dip the coal in the water then draw a magical stave on a wooden or stone surface such as a tree, a wooden sign etc, in which the stave glows slightly red.

You can choose one of the effects to apply:
	Brynslustafir:
		All forced physical impacts the target makes with their body or things they are holding (like a punch or using a weapon to hit) creates a faint blue flash of light, which slightly burns whatever the target hit with their body or weapon. Weapons the target is holding becomes sharper, and can cut things somewhat easier. The sharpness goes away once the target leaves the range.

	Magical Disruption:
		Instead of a specific target, all spells with the tier of Major or Powerful cannot be cast, and all concentrations and spellcasting for these spells are broken. Spells with the tiers of Basic and Minor are three times harder to cast, and spells that are instantly cast take a couple of seconds to finish and take effect.
	
	Repel Supernatural Being:
		Choose a type of creature (undead, fey, demon, elemental, celestial, or anything that doesn't originate from the Material Plane. Targets of this type cannot physically enter the range of the stave.
		
		If they try to enter the stave's range, they are pushed back as if a strong gust of wind hit them. However they can leave the area of the spell. It is possible to be forced into the area of the spell if there are several people there to force them in.
	
	Turret:
		This stave has 5 charges. Everytime a target enters the range of the stave, the stave "casts" a spell assigned to the stave. If the stave's spell doesn't have an instantaneous casting time, it instead starts glowing brighter. At the end of the stave casting it's spell, it is glowing twice more than normal. Once the stave finishes the spell casting or is countered by counterspell, it's light dims back to normal.

		If the spell requires a chosen target, the target will be one of the targets of this stave. If the spell requires a direction, the direction will be the direction towards the target. If the spell is placed instead, the spell takes effect at where the target is. If the spell requires concentration, then that concentration is maintained until the spell ends. If the spell requires an option or parameter like another stave spell, then you must decide that when drawing the stave by writing it in Primordial or any of the languages listed below around the stave.

		The stave replenishes one charge per two hours.

The stave's magic will be active until the drawing is destroyed, or dispelled. The rune cannot be washed away by mundane water, but other liquids like oil, tar, or magical water can.

In order to draw a stave, you must have studied some Primordial.

Choose a creature that is capable of speech such as a crow, raven, or parrot. Speak a message less than 25 words. You then specify a location you have seen, and a general appearance of the recipient. The animal then sets out to the specified location to deliver the message. If it's a flying creature, then the range covers 80 kilometers a day, or 40 kilometers for other animals.

When the animal finds a recipient, it stops somewhere within 3 meters of the recipient, and it speaks the message the way they would say it. For example, a crow sent to say a message will sound like a crow speaking.

If the target is possessed (not charmed!), the possessor will take a shot of mental pain. If the possessor dies, it is kicked out of the body and the target, who then collapses and will regain consciousness 1 hour later.
