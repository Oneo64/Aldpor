======================================================================================================================================================
OVERVIEW
======================================================================================================================================================

Potions are concoctions and mixtures of different items dissolved into water, and powered by a magic catalyst.

Two crushed amethyst gorbries as ingredients usually applies the effects of a spell, but only if the spell has a material component.
Example: Potion of Mage Armor has two crushed amethyst gorbries, and a handful of cobweb. A handful of cobweb is the material component for mage armor.

Two pickled and crushed practal gorbries, a pinch of coal powder, and some material as ingredients usually applies the effects of that material.
Example: Potion of Mage Armor has two crushed amethyst gorbries, and a handful of cobweb. A handful of cobweb is the material component for mage armor.

Sometimes, pickling the ingredient is required to make it more acidic, usually for anything that dissolves or break elements down. Fermentation would be required to enhance or make the igredients more potent if their original properties are too weak to be any use.



======================================================================================================================================================
BREWING STEPS
======================================================================================================================================================

	1.  Get a container. Lets suppose it's a small 6 inch cauldron (37 small vials), since ingredients below are assumed a the potion is being brewed in a cauldron.
	
	2.  Add water, then add a catalyst. Make sure the catalyst is fully submerged.
	2a. If you have magical water, you do not need a catalyst.
	
	3.  Add ingredients. Ingredients also must be fully submerged.
	3a. Make sure the water isn't a slop, and must be at least as 'watery' as syrup.
	
	4.  Boil it, and maintain continuous boiling for two hours. You can also let it sit instead for six hours, but it's potency is slightly lower.
	4a. You enhance the effects by leaving it boiling for another few hours, which will increase it's potency by about 25 percent.
	
	5.  Let it sit (again if it already sat for 6 hours in step 4) for at least 6 hours for the ingredients to fully dissolve before using.

	Based on the amount you drank, the potion could last from minutes to hours. A small vial (50 ml) could last 10 minutes, and a wine bottle (750 ml) could last 2.5 hours.
	Most potions require more than 50 ml to be drank to take effect.

	Game conversion: 1 ml = 12 seconds, 5 ml = 1 minute



======================================================================================================================================================
SOAKING
======================================================================================================================================================

You can soak various materials in potion to give them potion effects. This is how most 'magic' items are made, also the most common method. The other, less common but more powerful method is by directly giving the item magic by using the spell Imbuement, described in "MagicSystemAndSpells.txt".

Soaking times:
	Sand, dirt, powder:  Dump it in the potion to make a slop
	Cloth:               Just dip it in
	Wood:                4 hours
	Stone:               6 hours

	Meat:                5 minutes
	Plant:               10 minutes



======================================================================================================================================================
CATALYSTS
======================================================================================================================================================

A catalyst is required to make a potion. Without a catalyst, a "potion" would just be a gross mixture that might make you sick.
A catalyst is an object/liquid that is either magical, or it can be naturally occuring. They are what makes the potion's effect. Any nonliving thing that has an innate magical/natural connection can be considered a catalyst.

Here is a list of magical catalyst examples:
	The snow, or foliage where an intense magical battle happened.
	The grass from a magic academy's training grounds.
	The water from an ancient magical well.
	The core of a slain elemental.
	Water attuned to a god or moon.
	Flesh of a prolonged zombie.

	Basically anything that suffered either long-term magical activity, or short-term intense magical activity (fire bolting or using illusory script the ground a few times isn't going make it magical)

Here is a list of all naturally occuring catalysts, and naturally occuring magical catalysts:
	Cysts
	Bezoars
	Kidney stones
	Volcanic ash
	Volcanic rock or a powder of volcanic rock
	Water of a natural hot spring or geyser
	Water from a pond that was recently struck by lightning
	Wood that had been struck by lightning

	Amethyst gorbries
	Any plant, tree, or grass that grew in Furnalfa
	Any body part of a glimmering moth, preferabbly the wing or antenne
	Daeva horns
	Elemental cores

Drinking concoction bomb of earth:
	You start to feel full as if you've ate a meal, however you won't gain any nutritions. Also it tastes exactly like wet dirt.

Drinking poison solvent or potion acid:
	Your metabolism is slowed for an hour or two. Also, any potion or poison you consumed earlier suffers the same effect as described in the poison solvent or potion acid effects.

Eating any of the healing salves:
	It doesn't do anything beyond acting as a food.

Eating specifically bone-growing salve:
	Your metabolism is slowed for an hour or two.

Mixing/Drinking conflicting concoctions #1:
	Combinations:
		energy potion and nontoxic seizure concoction
		fire immunity potion and fire-throwing grenade

	Ignites in a fire similar to a lithium-ion battery fire, except the reaction is twice as fast. The reaction lasts until either one of the potion runs out. For example, if you mixed 100% energy potion with 20% nontoxic seizure concoction, it would combust until there was 80% energy potion left.

	If you consumed the potion/salve combination, you die.

Mixing/Drinking conflicting concoctions #2:
	Combinations:
		hailskin potion and fire immunity potion

		gardening growth concoction and rotting curse potion
		regeneration potion and rotting curse potion
		regenerative/reverting salve and rotting curse potion

		regenerative/reverting salve and hailskin potion
		regenerative/reverting salve and fire immunity potion

		potion of mage armor and abjuration dissolvent
	
	The mixture starts to boil until either one of the potion runs out. For example, if you mixed 100% hailskin potion with 20% fire immunity potion, it would boil until there was 80% hailskin potion left.

	If there are more than three reactions going at the same time, possible explosions can occur.

	If you consumed the potion/salve combination, instead of the boiling reaction happening in your stomach, you slightly lose some sense of balance (basically just dizziness) instead.
