======================================================================================================================================================
OVERVIEW
======================================================================================================================================================

Potions are concoctions and mixtures of different items dissolved into water, and powered by a magic catalyst.

Two crushed amethyst gorbries as ingredients usually applies the effects of a spell, but only if the spell has a material component.
Example: Potion of Mage Armor has two crushed amethyst gorbries, and a handful of cobweb. A handful of cobweb is the material component for mage armor.



======================================================================================================================================================
BREWING STEPS
======================================================================================================================================================

	1.  Get a container. Lets suppose it's a cauldron, since ingredients below are assumed a the potion is being brewed in a cauldron.
	
	2.  Add water, then add a catalyst. Make sure the catalyst is fully submerged.
	2a. If you have magical water, you do not need a catalyst.
	
	3.  Add ingredients. Ingredients also must be fully submerged.
	3a. Make sure the water isn't a slop, and must be at least as 'watery' as syrup.
	
	4.  Boil it. This will take two hours. You can also let it sit, but this will take six hours.
	4a. You enhance the effects by leaving it boiling for another few hours, which will increase it's potency by about 25 percent.
	
	5.  Let it sit (again if it already sat for 6 hours in step 4) for at least 6 hours for the ingredients to fully dissolve before using.

	Based on the amount you drank, the potion could last from minutes to hours. A small vial (20 ml) could last 10 minutes, and a wine bottle (750 ml) of potion could last 6 hours. Most potions require more than 10 ml to be drank to take effect.

	Game conversion: 1 ml = 0.5 minutes (30 seconds)



======================================================================================================================================================
SOAKING
======================================================================================================================================================

You can soak various materials in potion to give them potion effects. This is how most 'magic' items are made, also the most common method. The other, less common but more powerful method is by directly giving the item magic by using the spell Imbuement, described in "MagicSystemAndSpells.txt".

Soaking times:
	Sand, dirt, powder:  Dump it in the potion to make a slop
	Cloth:               Just dip it in
	Wood:                4 hours
	Stone:               6 hours

	Meat:                5 minutes
	Plant:               10 minutes



======================================================================================================================================================
CATALYSTS
======================================================================================================================================================

A catalyst is required to make a potion. Without a catalyst, a "potion" would just be a gross mixture that might make you sick.
A catalyst is a magical object/liquid that is what makes the potion's effect. Any nonliving thing that has an innate magical connection can be considered a catalyst.

Here are a list of catalyst examples:
	The snow, or foliage where an intense magical battle happened.
	The foliage near a magical creatures' lair.
	The grass from a magic academy's training grounds.
	The water from an ancient magical well.
	The core of a slain elemental.
	Water attuned to a god or moon.
	Flesh of a prolonged zombie.

	Basically anything that suffered either long-term magical activity, or short-term intense magical activity (fire bolting or using illusory script the ground a few times isn't going make it magical)
