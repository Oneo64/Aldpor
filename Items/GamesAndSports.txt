[[SPORTS]]

Academy of Aldorim's training sport:
	Workings:
		Once every week, the academy hosts a sport where students are assigned to two teams. Their goal is to 'eliminate' the opposing members, but they are restricted to using harmless spells. Being hit with a spell means you're out, and must leave the game field. The team to win each gets 3 copper pieces.

		Team members are free to form any sort of hierarchy, and they are also able to surrender.

		Rules:
			- You may only use Illusion of Bolt.
			- If both teams still have active players after one hour, the game stops and the team with the more active players win.
