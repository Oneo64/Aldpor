!THIS IS A TEST MAGIC SYSTEM, DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING HERE FOR GRANTED!


[[OVERVIEW]]
Magics:
	- Druidry incantations are spoken in Druidic, and are all nature-based.
	- Seidr is a practice of foresight and altering luck. You must be born with these abilities to use this.
	- Sorcery is when you can make simple magic happen by whim. You must be born with these abilities to use this.
	- Scroll Sorcery is when you make simple magic reading a chant from a scroll, made by a sorcerer.
	- Arcane magic is a practice where magic is made by doing gestures, speaking an incantation, and holding materials.

Components:
	V = Verbal (wizards and seers chant in Primordial, druids chant in either Druidic or Sylvan, sorcerers don't need to chant)
	S = Somatic (weaving the spell, doing some ritual shit like drawing circles or coating in powder, any magic other than wizard/arcane magic uses SG instead)
	SG = Somatic gesture (simply pointing, touching, reaching, waving, wrist flicking, etc)
	M = Material

Create Scroll (requires intermediate arcane research):
After writing arcane symbols and runes in a scroll, you infuse part of your power into that scroll. Once this is done, anyone can use this scroll as a new type of magic practice called Scroll Sorcery. You can only create one scroll per day, as you won't have enough power to create another.



[[ARCANE MAGIC]]
====================================================================================================
Arcane Spells: Spells that are cast by gestures and incantations. Most of these spells aren't powerful enough to easily break through a wooden shield.
Magical Staves: Magical symbols drawn on wooden surfaces, will remain until the wood breaks or rots, or if the drawing is washed off.

Magical Staves (intermediate, 1 month to learn one stave):
You can create a magical stave by drawing a symbol on a wood surface with coal, then say an incantation to activate it. The runic staves are about half a meter in radius and will glow slightly red. The drawing cannot be washed off by clear mundane water but can be removed by: vinegar/brine, saltwater, magical water, oil, tar, and blood.
The incantation will include what the stave will do, and who will be effected by it. Whoever is affected can be described a mix of: name, physical appearance, clothing, medical condition, race, ethnicity, age.
These are the staves you can make:
	- Gapaldur: Targets in a 20 meter range are physically stronger when bare-handed.
	- Vegvisir: Targets in a 20 meter range are more resilient to cold weather, wind and rain, won't be soaked as easily, and are more unlikely to be struck by lightning.
